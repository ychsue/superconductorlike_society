[English](./en/) | [中文](./zh-tw/)

## Implementation Projects

To realize the blueprint of a Superconductor-like Society, the following implementation projects have been initiated:

- **[NonBlockingLife](https://github.com/ychsue/NonBlockingLife)**
  - A personal life scheduling system (currently focused on tasks).
- **[ActionManifold](https://github.com/ychsue/ActionManifold)**
  - A system for managing activity manifolds. Designed to make activities extensible, allow dynamic process changes, support replay & resume, and facilitate easy process management development.
