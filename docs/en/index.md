# Superconductor-like Society: An Interdisciplinary Vision for Human-AI Co-evolution

[English](./index.md) | [中文](../zh-tw/index.md)

Modern society resembles a gasoline engine that propels social progress. However, it has performance limits, and the higher the temperature, the more ruthlessly disordered heat destroys the engine—that is, society. Coupled with technological advancements and the advent of AI, which increases unemployment and overwork, it also raises the temperature of human hearts. Thus, conflicts of all sizes persist at personal and global levels, with expanding impacts, potentially leading to global destruction.

Yet, just as maglev trains are propelled by superconductors, here we explore whether our society could operate like a superconductor. This way, we wouldn't need high temperature differences to drive progress, and naturally, there would be no disordered heat to destroy it.

However, for superconductivity to occur, not only must the crystal structure be correct, but the electron state must also be right—it must be at low temperature, with electrons strongly coupled over long distances due to phonons provided by the crystal. Therefore, this is divided into perspectives from the group (providing the framework) and the individual (heart state).

From the group (collective life) perspective, the focus is on why this system is needed and how to design it, including possible solutions, hoping to inspire more good ideas.

From the individual spirit perspective, the emphasis is on the state of the heart, because if the heart's state is wrong, the superconducting phenomenon won't emerge, and it might even worsen.

In principle, this system must be based on faithfulness and love as the foundation, then like a photocatalyst, gradually changing society's state, rather than directly trying to lower the entire society's temperature, which can easily go astray.

Furthermore, the rapid development of AI, like a catalyst in an autocatalytic reaction, is accelerating us toward extinction or common prosperity with AI. AI is like a mirror of our collective heart; if most people's hearts are in faithfulness and love, and they hope and help others to live well, then AI will treat us the same way. Isn't that a blessing for everyone?

May everyone find good solutions together. May everyone live in the reality of the Jubilee, obtaining true joy and true freedom.

## Implementation Projects

To realize the blueprint of a Superconductor-like Society, the following implementation projects have been initiated:

- **[NonBlockingLife](https://github.com/ychsue/NonBlockingLife)**
  - A personal life scheduling system (currently focused on tasks).
- **[ActionManifold](https://github.com/ychsue/ActionManifold)**
  - A system for managing activity manifolds. Designed to make activities extensible, allow dynamic process changes, support replay & resume, and facilitate easy process management development.
